# Advent of Code

My trials on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)! I started in 2023 and I'm not quite experienced with development yet.

I'm also inspired from [this repo](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/advent-of-code/) and [his](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiSIL42pQRpc-8JNiYDFyzQ) [video](https://youtu.be/fEQv-cqzbPg).

For Kotlin part of the code, I'm using the [JetBrains's Kotlin Template](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/advent-of-code-kotlin-template). Of course, I didn't clone it like how others did it :)

I don't have much to fill in right here yet, so come back here later if you want more details!

### Notes of 2023

I am going to try learning Rust and Kotlin by 2024. Yes, another guy who wants to learn programming language by participating in Advent of Code!

## TODO

- Add Kotlin directory! I didn't solve with Kotlin yet
- I should set up more proper justfile.
- I haven't thought of which LICENSE to use yet.

ðŸŽ„ Merry Christmas (If it is for you), and happy coding!
